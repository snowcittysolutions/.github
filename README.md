## About

[![GangLand][product-screenshot]](https://snowcittysecuritysolutions.us)

Snow Citty Security Solutions was founded by a life-long tech enthusiast with over 20 years of experience building and securing computer systems. We provide industry-leading cybersecurity services tailored to companies of all sizes. Our solutions range from penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to managed security services and training.

Our team has discovered some of the largest data breaches and helped defend critical infrastructure against sophisticated nation-state actors. We leverage this real-world expertise to build proactive defenses focused on detecting and disrupting advanced attacks.

At Snow Citty, we believe security requires a partnership between man and machine. Our security experts work side-by-side with our technology to provide comprehensive protection across your entire digital ecosystem.
