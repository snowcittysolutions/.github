## Getting Started

To start securing your business, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed (required for the API integration)
- Your GuardingUS-AI API key (register on our [website](https://guardingus-ai.tech)) 

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this code repository 
2. Install the required Python packages  
3. Set your API key as an environment variable
4. Import and instantiate the `GuardingUSClient` class
5. Start calling API methods like `analyze()`, `detect_threats()`, etc!

We have code snippets below to help with each step.

And that's it! Our API docs explain all available methods in detail. Let us know if any part of the setup is confusing.

## Usage Example

Here's a quick demo of analyzing some text for threats:

```python
from guardingus_ai import GuardingUSClient

client = GuardingUSClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

text = "Meet me at the usual place at noon" 

results = client.analyze(text)

if results['threat_detected']:
  print("Threat found! Here are the details:")
  print(results['threat_details'])
else:
  print("No threats found.")
```

The `analyze()` method checks for threats, anomalies, sensitive info, and more based on the text. Pretty cool right?

There's a ton more you can do with the API. Check the docs or reach out if you need help with a specific use case!
